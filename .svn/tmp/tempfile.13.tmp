# NEED TO DO
---------------------------------
Add template function to act like a macro that tests pointers to see if they are null

# SHOULD DO
---------------------------------
Memory_Map:
- Add function to allocate new space for file formats that do not provide a base address and size of the image
  e.g. mem_map_ptr->allocate (address1, size1);
       mem_map_ptr->allocate (address2, size2);

  NOTE: Verify that the previous method of determining size (number of entries in list) still holds. That is there are no gaps in the allocated memory space.

IO:Java_Class Reader:
- Finished Field_Access_Flags
  - Send it what type the field access flags are releated to because there
    are different rules for Classes, Interfaces, etc.
- Finish Method_Access_Flags

- Why do we have a string argument to get_Meta_Info in the Java class reader?

# WANT TO DO
---------------------------------
- Handle Windows NE file headers
- Handle C# bytecode files
- Provide ability to read export name poitner table of the imported DLL using hint to get name
- For determining the file type we should only create a Memory_Map of the size of the magic
  number for a target input file. This should speed up detection significantly.

- Elf: Remove stringstream uses where the stream property is not used. For example returning the Elf Class in Elf_Header_Eident::get_Elf_Class.
